            <h2><strog>Why The Bison Should Be Your Favorite Animal</strog></h2>
                 <h3>The American Bison is an iconic animal to the United states great plains region.
                     It is one of my favorite animals because it is a magestic animal, also how big and strong is also very impresive.
                     Another good point to why I like the Bison is because it helped to define the identity of our animal trade industry and grew it greatly.
                     Although it did come with great consuquences.
                      Because the hide was so valuable and in such high demande it caussed over hunting wiping out a good precent of their population. 
                    It is also an indangerd animal, so takeing care of the population and reviveing it is a big deal.</h3>
                
                 <h2><strong>Bison Restoration</strong></h2>
                 <h3>Because the Bison population is so limited and struggles to maintain itself biologest are working to help restore thepopulation size again.
                    The increase of population has greatly increased and will contiue to increase.
                    But the process is very long and tedius and will take about a couple decades to fully get the Bison populations back up to what they use to be like.
                 </h3>

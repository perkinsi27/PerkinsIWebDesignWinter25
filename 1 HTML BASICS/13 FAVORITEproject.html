             <h2>Why The Bison Should Be Your Favorite Animal</h2>
                    <p>The American Bison is an iconic animal to the United states great plains region.
                     It is one of my favorite animals because it is a magestic animal, also how big and strong is also very impresive.
                     Another reason is that the Bison travel in very <strong>VERY</strong> large groups which then bring them into becomeing a big family.
                     Because they are a big family their population in the Great Plains was MASSIVE.
                     Another good point to why I like the Bison is because it helped to define the identity of our animal trade industry and grew it greatly.
                     It grew greatly due to the fact that the coat of the Bison is a very valuable and keeps warmth in very wall.
                     Because of this there was such a high value and demade for Bison coats they were really over hunted.
                     Hunting the Bison did come with great consuquences.
                     With being over hunted their numbers dwindeled a great amount and started to faid away.
                     So President Nixon made Bison an indangerd animal, which then protected them from being hunted and to help recoperate their population.
                     So the collage of Colorado State started to repopulate the American Bison in the area,
                     they made takeing care of the Bison population and reviveing it a big deal.</p>

                 <h2>Bison Restoration</h2>
                    <p>Because the Bison population is so limited and struggles to maintain itself biologest are working to help restore the population size again.
                     The increase of population has greatly increased and will contiue to increase.
                     But the process is very long and tedius and will take about a couple decades to fully get the Bison populations back up to what they use to be like.
                     Although the full population at first wasnt all true Bison it was more of a mix breed,
                     the population will evetually make the Bison true full Bison and not just mix bread with Buffalo.
                     The repopulation if Bison in the Great Plains will become very high and hopefully within the next few decades we will see big numbers of free range Bison.
                     With the efforts of Colorado and some induvuail scientes the Bison population will increase a vast amount.</p>

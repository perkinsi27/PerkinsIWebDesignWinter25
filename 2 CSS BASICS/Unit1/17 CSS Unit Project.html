    <h3 class="paragrapheader">What is Robotics</h3>
        <div>
            <p>
                Robotics is a very fun, competative, and entertaining hobby of mine. 
                I love this because it is a very hands on, you also need to be able to think out side of the box.
                The club at Divine Child is very good. We have made it to the states the last five years and are looking to make a push to Worlds.
                The challenging part about makeing it to worlds is you have to be <strong><em>REALLY GOOD</em></strong> expsualy in Michigan.
                Michigan has <stong>514</stong> teams in the state, the most in the world for an area.
                For example there are about 500 hundred teams that go to worlds, 68 teams are from Michigan.

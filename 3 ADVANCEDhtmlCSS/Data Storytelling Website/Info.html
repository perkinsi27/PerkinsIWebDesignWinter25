        <h3>Language Development</h3>
            <p>The first years of childhood are a critical period for the acquisition of language skills such as vocabulary and phonology, which are essentially learned through interactions with adults.
                 A number of studies highlight that both the quality and amount of such adult child interactions play a crucial role in ensuring the acquisition of language.
                 However, there have been mounting worries regarding the implications of screen time, which has the potential to restrict the quantity and quality of such interactions.
                 This can, in turn, limit children's opportunities to practice and develop their language.
                 The relationship between screen use and language development is complex and influenced by a variety of contextual factors. 
                 These include caregivers' behavior when they use screens, whether the material is appropriate for the child's age, and the level of interactivity offered by the media.
                 It is not sufficient to only count screen hours to understand the full impact context is important.
                 Research shows that excessive screen use in early childhood is associated with negative impacts on language, cognition, motor, and social development.
                 Conversely, where screen time is introduced later in life or where parents do co view and engage with the content alongside their children, there are some beneficial effects on language development.

                 Also, background television where a television set is kept on in the room but not attended to interferes with children's cognitive and language development, especially in children younger than five.
                 Children who watch more than one or two hours of television daily have a greater risk of behavioral problems and reduced vocabulary scores compared to children with limited exposure.
                 To promote healthy growth, parents and caregivers need to be informed about the risks of excessive or inappropriate screen use, particularly for children under three.
                 Parents can be encouraged to engage in alternative, interactive activities parent child play, for instance which can facilitate language development and overall development.
                 The alternatives should be easily available in pediatric clinics and early education schools.
                 Future studies should also investigate family wide screen use patterns to further understand their combined effect on children's language abilities, particularly lexical development.</p>
        
        <h3>Social-Emotional Development</h3>
            <p>The rise in children's screen time, driven by ubiquitous digital device use, has been linked to negative effects on physical health, sleep, emotional development, and mental health.
                 Excessive and early exposure, especially to violent or fast paced content, can lead to behavioral issues, reduced emotional understanding, and cognitive delays.
                 However, high quality educational content can be beneficial, particularly for children over the age of two.
                 Effective strategies in managing screen time include increasing parental awareness, using monitoring software, and providing school and health care provider guidance.
                 Early intervention is key in promoting healthier development and habits.
                 <br>
                 <br>
                 Face to face interaction with caregivers remains necessary for young children to acquire language, social, and emotional abilities.
                 Screen time cannot replace such meaningful human interactions, especially during the first few years of development.
                 Encouraging other activities like interactive play, reading, and outdoor activities can help ensure a healthier and more balanced environment for children's development.</p>

        <h3>Role of Parents in Managing Screen Time</h3>
            <p>Parents typically use screen time as a reward but are also concerned with its negative effects on their child's behavior, socialization ability, sleep habits, and level of activity.
                 Parental monitoring of screen activity through rule setting, and control and behavioral management makes them powerful enough to impact screen behavior.
                 Research indicates that the implementation of limits on children's access to technology, such as televisions, smart phones, and tablets, is an indicator that children spend less time on screens.
                 Parental settings and device password protection have also been found to respond to concerns over managing screen time.
                 Age based limits of screen time and removing screens from bedrooms are recommended by the CDC, as well as other institutions, in an effort to limit a significant amount of screen time.

                 Parental role models also impact the children's media use.
                 Kids brought up in homes where TV watching is common, emaples, during meals or after school, will likely acquire a binge-watching habit.
                 Parents viewing more than four hours of TV per day translate to their children being much more likely to imitate them, once again pointing to the extremely strong correlation between child and parental media use.
                 This emphasizes the importance of establishing boundaries and demonstrating healthy screen time habits in the home.</p>

    <main><h2>Why Should We Worry About Screen Time With Children?</h2>
    <p>We have learned that the implactions of haveing to much time on a screen without a break or just long hours can be detrimental.
        It causes harm to their cognitive, linguistic, and social-emotional growth.
        Which can be extremely detrimental to children expecualy because their brain is still growing and developing while they age.
        If they don't properly have the correct development it will set them back a whole lot in their life and will add a lot more challenges to their life's when their older.
        It'll affect them even more when older because of the lack of those skills they lost when they were younger.
        It is very important that we address these issue when the children are young, and make sure they develop well.

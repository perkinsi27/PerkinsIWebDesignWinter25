<h2>Air Force Piolt falls into the feild of aviation.</h2>

    <p> Air force piolts are the best in the world.
        They get payed the most and are all officers, I think.
        Air Force Piolts are also way better than Navy piolts.
        Also being a C-130J Piolt will give me good experience and help transtion into commertial aviation.

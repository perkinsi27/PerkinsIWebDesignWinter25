	        <h1>What Makes Octopuses so Interesting?</h1>
	        <hr>
	        <h2>Intelligence</h2>
	        <p>
	            Octopuses are extremely intelligent.  They have been known to
	            solve complex problems in captivity.  They play with toys and
	            are great escape artists.  They can recognize particular people
	            and display emotions, such as anger.
	        </p>
	        
	        <hr>
	        <h2>Color Shifting</h2>
	        <p>
	            Chameleons aren't the only animals with color shifting skin!
	            Octopuses are able to change the color and texture of their
	            skin at will.  This makes them great camouflage artists, which
	            in turns makes them hard to find and dangerous predators!
	        </p>

	        <h2>Anatomy</h2>
	        <p>
	            Octopuses have three hearts, eight arms, suckers on their arms,
	            a highly developed central nervous system, a beak, and a siphon.
	       </p>
	            The siphon is used for movement, to shoot ink, and to draw water
	            over the octopus's gills to breathe.
	       <p>
	       </p>
	            Two of the octopus's hearts pump blood to their gills, while the
	            third handles pumping blood to the rest of the body.
	       <p>
	       </p>
	            The octopus has arms, not tentacles!  Each arm is covered with
	            very sensitive suckers that send tactile and taste information
	            back to the brain.  The octopus can feel and taste with his suckers!
